## My journey of learning and improving üìàüå±

The journey was incredible and I learnt a lot of things and because of contributions,
I learnt more javascript to solve some issues, I learnt many commands 
of git and learnt how to use github. Generally many beginners face difficulty
in using github (including me üòÖ ) but now it seemed very familiar to use github
and now i comfortably use github üéâ <br>

This journey was a stepping stone toward my growth in **open source and web development**.  
I'm excited to explore more and contribute to impactful projects in the future! üöÄüíô
